The project also benefits greatly from the ongoing support and enthusiasm from its volunteers, both official and unofficial, and is grateful for the time and efforts invested in the project by past and present volunteers.

The freenode project keeps a keen eye out for individuals who may provide a good fit to the existing volunteer base and we periodically recruit existing participants who have made a strong positive impression and we believe would be a good fit on the staff team.

If you are looking for freenode volunteers on the freenode network you can find us in _#freenode_ where we are always happy to have a chat or you can use _/stats p_ to find volunteers that are immediately available.
